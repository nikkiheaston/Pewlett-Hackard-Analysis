# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Purpose

#### The purpose of this analysis is to use SQL to review retirement data for Pewlett Hackard and provide high-level information to management about the large number of expected retirees within the company and decisions on immediate hiring needs.

### Results
#### - My analysis shows that 72,458 employees are retiring soon. By title, there are a significant number of senior-level employees who will be retiring. Together they account for 70% of the employees retiring. 
#### - The number of retirees who work in engineering accounts for 50% of all retirees.

#### - The number of employees who are eligible for the mentorship program is 1,549.
#### - The spread of eligible employees by job title are not quite parallel to the number of employees by title, for example - there are more Engineers than Senior Engineers which is in opposition to the number of retirees. Similarly, there are not many more Senior Staff who are eligible in comparison to regular Staff. Also, there are no managers who are eligible for the mentorship program.

### Summary
#### The company will need to fill over 72,000 roles in the coming years. 
#### There are a plethora of retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation - at the lowest it's 18:1 for retirees to next gen and at most 85:1. 
#### Altogether, the company is losing 30% of its workforce in the coming years. All employees by title are displayed in the all_current_titles.csv file attatched to this repository.
#### In order to help the company balance the hiring and retiring processes, I've broken up the retirement stages across 4 years, according to the retirees' birth years. Each year PH will need to hire between 17,000 to 19,000 new employees.
